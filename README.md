Av's Luhny Bin
==============

Taking up the (admittedly aging) challenge from Square (see http://corner.squareup.com/2011/11/luhny-bin.html), I've attempted an implementation of the Luhn filter using C# with an additional wrinkle - I'm aiming for a decidedly functional style.

To execute on Windows, I'm using win-bash.
* Download from here: http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/
* Unzip to, e.g., `c:\win-bash`
* Add to path, e.g., `set path=%path%;c:\win-bash`
* Run (from repo root) - `sh run.sh`
